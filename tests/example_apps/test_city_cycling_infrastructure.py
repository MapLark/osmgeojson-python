"""
App idea: overlay dedicated cycling infrastructure on a city basemap.

Combines cycleways, bike lanes (``cycleway=lane`` on roads), and shared
bus+bike lanes common in Stockholm.

On-road bike lanes in OSM use four key forms:
  - ``cycleway=*``        — undirected (applies to both sides of the road)
  - ``cycleway:left=*``   — left-side lane only
  - ``cycleway:right=*``  — right-side lane only
  - ``cycleway:both=*``   — explicit both-sides shorthand

All four keys are OR-combined so no lane is silently omitted.  Only
positive infrastructure values are matched; ``cycleway=no`` and
``cycleway=separate`` explicitly mean no lane is present.

API calls:
  - ``type=way&shape=line&tags=highway=cycleway``
  - ``type=way&shape=line&or_tags=[cycleway=lane, cycleway:left=lane, ...]``
