"""
App idea: "walking directions" feature.

Fetch the pedestrian footway network inside a small Stockholm bbox, build an
undirected weighted graph, then use Dijkstra to find the shortest walking
route between two points in the network.

The route is returned as an ordered list of (lon, lat) waypoints that a
frontend could render as a highlighted path on the map.

Graph construction:
  - Nodes: ``(lon, lat, layer)`` tuples — the layer prevents grade-separated
    crossings (bridges, tunnels) from being falsely joined to at-grade ways
    sharing the same coordinate.
  - Edge weights: haversine distance in metres.

API calls: multiple ``type=way&shape=line&tags=highway=<type>`` queries,
one per pedestrian highway type, merged client-side with deduplication.
