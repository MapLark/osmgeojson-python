"""
App idea: adventure cycling layer showing unpaved trails where cycling is
explicitly permitted — ideal for MTB or gravel bike route planning.

OSM tags used:
  - ``highway=path`` + ``bicycle=yes`` or ``bicycle=designated``
  - ``highway=track`` + ``bicycle=yes`` or ``bicycle=designated``

API calls use ``or_tags`` to match either bicycle permission value.
