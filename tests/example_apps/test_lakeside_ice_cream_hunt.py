"""
App idea: recommend ice cream shops that are close to a lake or waterfront —
a classic summer Stockholm activity.

Two-step query:
  1. Fetch water bodies (``natural=water``) with polygon geometry
  2. Fetch ice cream shops (``amenity=ice_cream``) as nodes
  3. Compute haversine distance from each shop to the nearest point on each
     water body's polygon *boundary* (measuring to edge segments, not just
     vertices) and collect the closest matches.

Measuring to segments rather than vertices means a shop beside the middle of
a long edge reports the true perpendicular distance instead of the distance to
the nearest endpoint, keeping rankings accurate for water bodies with sparse
vertex spacing.

API calls:
  - ``type=way,relation&shape=polygon&tags=natural=water``
  - ``tags=amenity=ice_cream``
